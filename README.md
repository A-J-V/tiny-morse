# tiny-morse
This small script converts a string of text into Morse code and flashes it on a device (script works out-of-the-box on Raspberry Pi Pico W).

For many individuals, flashing an LED on a Raspberry Pi Pico (or similar device) is the first step in learning to program microcontrollers. It is the "hello world" of the microcontroller world.

However, it's boring and not particularly useful. This tiny project aims to make flashing an LED more interesting by giving you something to flash: Morse code.

This is a great project for people learning to program microcontrollers for themselves or with their children. Morse code is still relevant because it is so minimalistic and portable.

Morse code is also a great way to introduce elementary information theory or cryptography. It can be built upon for many small and amusing projects.

If you're using a device other than the Raspberry Pi Pico W, you'll need to modify the script to work with your device.
